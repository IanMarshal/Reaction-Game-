# Reaction-Game-
A simple reaction Game for Next js practice 
# Reaction Speed Challenge 🎮

A lightweight JavaScript mini-game that measures how quickly a player reacts to a visual cue.  
The game is designed to demonstrate **JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game state management**.

This project was built as part of my personal practice for Sofware development

🚀 Live Gameplay Concept
After clicking **Start Game**, the player waits for a colored box to appear.  
Once visible, the player must click the box as quickly as possible. The game calculates the reaction time in milliseconds and tracks the best score.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – semantic structure and layout
- **CSS3** – responsive styling and UI presentation
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – game logic, timing, and DOM interaction

🎯 Key Features
- Randomized delay before the target appears
- Accurate reaction time calculation using timestamps
- Best score tracking during the session
- Responsive, cross-browser compatible interface
- Clean, readable, and well-structured code

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Event handling (`click` events)
- Game state management
- Timers (`setTimeout`)
- DOM manipulation
- Debugging and performance awareness
- Separation of concerns (HTML / CSS / JS)
